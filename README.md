## Hi there, I'm Elvis Ndayishimiye 👋

## Building the Next Generation of Financial Infrastructure

I'm a multifaceted engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable, and automated systems at the intersection of finance and technology. My expertise spans from foundational software engineering and complex data pipelines to mission-critical DevOps and MLOps.

My philosophy is to bridge the gap between brilliant quantitative ideas and production-ready, institutional-grade technology. I don't just build tools; I architect solutions that generate alpha, manage risk, and provide a competitive edge.

### Core Competencies

*   **💻 Software Engineering:** Crafting high-performance, testable, and maintainable backend services and APIs. Fluent in building the logic that powers complex financial applications.
*   **🔗 Data Engineering:** Architecting and implementing end-to-end ETL/ELT pipelines. I turn raw, messy data (from APIs, web scrapes, or real-time feeds) into clean, reliable, and actionable intelligence for quant models and analytics.
*   **☁️ DevOps & MLOps:** Designing and deploying secure, scalable, and automated infrastructure as code (IaC). I build the CI/CD and GitOps frameworks that allow quant researchers and developers to ship strategies and models faster and more reliably.
*   **🕸️ Web Scraping & Alternative Data:** Unlocking value from the public web. I specialize in building resilient scraping engines to gather non-traditional datasets that provide unique market insights.
